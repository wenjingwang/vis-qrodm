## Introduction

Outlier diagnostic models are widely used for detecting influential points in regression models. We are interested in the following questions:

(1) Where is the boundaries of `normal` and `outlier` in data space produced by the diagnostic models?

(2) How to judge the performance of different diagnostic models?

(3) In non-linear regression case where the influential points are not determined `distance`, how can we locating them?

## General Framework of Visualizing Oultier Diagnostic Models





## Example 1: Quantile Regression





## Visualizing Outlier Diagnostic Models for quantile regression Model

### Linear Case

### Non-linear Case

## Visualizing Outlier Diagnostic Models for Mix Level Model
