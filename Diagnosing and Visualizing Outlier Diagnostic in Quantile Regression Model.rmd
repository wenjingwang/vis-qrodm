# Introduction

## Background of quantile regression


## Outlier detection in regression and HLMdiag

 
# Outlier detection in quantile regression

* The further the greater of the outlier effects?

In mean regression, the further outliers locate from the original
data, the much they will affect the regression model. However, it is
not the same in quantile regression model.

The higher bound of quantile regression line affected by the outliers
in 



<!---
The machanism of how outliers affect quantile regression models is
different from mean regression. Since we construct regression model on
each quantile, outliers may have different effect on different
models.
